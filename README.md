Scripts and data used to perform + plots results for sensitivity analysis schemes one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and a 2^(9-5) fractional factorial design (FFD) setup.

# Scripts

All scripts can be found in the "scripts" folder.
* single\_factors[...] scripts are used to do OFAT analysis
* fractional\_factorial[...] scripts are used to do FFD analysis
* calculate\_PA\_indices[...] â€“ these simply produce a dictionary for intersection indices per dataset
* other scripts are otherwise used mostly for visualization purposes, e.g. to plot PV loops for specific combinations

# Underlying data

Data used for our publication will be published upon manuscript acceptance.

In "scripts/mainfolder.yaml", please update the paths to the location either for download or (if ever applicable) your own data files.
